# data-science-portfolio
A home for all my data science projects.

My name is Nick Desmond. At the time of writing, I am studying a Masters Degree in Data Science at the University of the West of England, Bristol.

My main interests are sports analytics, particularly Football.

I hope you enjoy reading through some of my projects!

Hopefully i have now updated this, so only njd2-desmond(personal) makes changes, and not nj2-desmond(my UWE git).
